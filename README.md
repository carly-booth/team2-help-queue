# Help Queue Application 

 

### Description 

The Help Queue Application is a web-hosted application, intended for Atos employees to receive IT assistance directly from IT support staff, in the form of tickets. 

Employees can post a ticket to the help queue, containing a description of their problem and its level of urgency, to which IT support staff then can post a solution. Employees can update their tickets whilst in the queue, to change the description or level or urgency. 

A list of _completed_ tickets is publicly accessible within the application, so employees can search for and retrieve the solution they require, before posting a ticket. Completed tickets can be easily filtered via keywords, enabling efficient and quick access to solutions, minimising downtime.  

IT support staff work through the queue of tickets, which are ordered based on waiting time (_time created_, earliest to latest) and the urgency of each ticket. Once an employee’s ticket has been resolved, they can mark it as _completed_ and becomes publicly accessible. Employees can also access the _My Tickets_ page, where they can view their current, open tickets and completed, closed tickets. 

This Spring Boot application utilises Jenkins (CI server), a GCP SQL database and Docker.

### Project Development 

To begin, we assigned roles within the Scrum Team; back-end and front-end developers, DevOps developers and documentation leads.  

We then collectively created a product backlog containing 3 main tasks, with subtasks within each; Create documentation, Create homepage/template for general front-end pages and Work on DevOps operations. Other issues in the backlog comprised user stories. Once completed, tasks within the backlog were assigned to each team member to begin working on, either individually or in pairs/groups.  After work on our own tasks began, we had daily stand ups, as well as frequent discussions during the day to get help/advice/feedback from each other. 

Midway through the project, changes were made to the project specification; the application would be intended for internal use at Atos, rather than a classroom training tool. As this change was only superficial, alterations were quickly made to the business case and business model canvas to meet the new requirements. No changes were necessary to the back-end as the application would function the same. The product backlog items’ titles and descriptions were not updated, as the actual tasks remained the same, just with superficial changes to certain words. Essentially, the change to the specification did not significantly delay project progression. 

 


 

The initial tasks completed were DevOps operations: setting up Jenkins within GCP, with a webhook, ensuring Spring Boot ran from the GCP console and applying Docker for containerisation. After these were completed, joining the back and front-end could begin. 

 

Documentation of the project began with developing a business case (what, why, who, how and future vision) and producing a Business Model Canvas. 

A list of technical requirements was put together, describing the user story or back-end setup, target user (employee/IT support/developer), task description and goal, and acceptance criteria.  Once the technical specification had been compiled, full system and component diagrams were created.

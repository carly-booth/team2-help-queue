# Help Queue Application for Atos

### Description

The Help Queue Application is a web-hosted application, intended for Atos employees to receive IT assistance directly from IT support staff, in the form of tickets. 

Employees can post a ticket to the help queue, containing a description of their problem and its level of urgency, to which IT support staff then can post a solution. Employees can update their tickets whilst in the queue, to change the description or level or urgency. 

A list of _completed_ tickets is publicly accessible within the application, so employees can search for and retrieve the solution they require, before posting a ticket. Completed tickets can be easily filtered via keywords, enabling efficient and quick access to solutions, minimising downtime.  

IT support staff work through the queue of tickets, which are ordered based on waiting time (_time created_, earliest to latest) and the urgency of each ticket. Once an employeeâ€™s ticket has been resolved, they can mark it as _completed_ and becomes publicly accessible. 

This Spring Boot application uses Jenkins (CI server), GCP SQL database and Docker.

Other issues in the backlog comprised user stories. Once completed, tasks within the backlog were assigned to each team member to begin working on, either individually or in pairs/groups.  After work on our own tasks began, we had daily stand ups, as well as frequent discussions during the day to get help/advice/feedback from each other.
